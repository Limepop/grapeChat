        <h1>Secret Hitler</h1>
        <p>
        For this game, you will be assigned a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler (who is also a Fascist). The Fascists must enact 6 policies of theirs or elect Hitler as Chancellor after enacting 3. The Liberals must enact 5 policies or assassinate Hitler. Each turn, a presidential candidate will be nominated, indicated by the blue outline. This player can choose a Chancellor candidate (indicated with red outline), and both these players are voted on. If the vote passes, then the president chooses 2 policies from a random 3 to give to the Chancellor. The Chancellor then must choose 1 of those two to enact. If a fascist policy passes, a new ability becomes available (they include: Investigate, Special Election, Policy Peek, and Execution), which must be used before the turn ends. If 5 fascist policies are enacted, then policy options can all be discarded if the president and chancellor agree. After the president enacts a policy and uses an ability (if applicable), a new election is held. However, the last ELECTED president or chancellor cannot be chosen as Chancellor.
